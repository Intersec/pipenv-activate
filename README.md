## Tests

We are using the unit test framework
[shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2).

Each test `./test/*_test.sh` can be run individually, but it is also possible
to run all tests for all shells supported by
[shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) on your platform by running the
script `./tests/run_all_scripts`.
